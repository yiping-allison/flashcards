# ECS 162 : LANGO! Project #

Lango is a flashcard review web app with the following features:

The app uses Google's Translate API for on-demand translation and OAuth API for user verification.

** I have not included the server code because it contains sensitive information (API keys). I will upload an API key-free
version after cleaning the file. **
> Please email me if you have any other questions or concerns!

### Front-end Design ###
The basic website design was created by a designer for the class (Jamie). We implemented the design through Facebook's
React framework, CSS, and minimal HTML.

## License ##
This project was created as an assignment for ECS 162 at UC Davis (Spring 2019).
I do not own any rights to the designs, so please do not copy them! Thanks!
The code and design are released for showcase purposes.
