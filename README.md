# ECS 162: LANGO! Project #

## What is Lango? ##
Lango is a flashcard review web app with the following features:
* User login/saves
* Review functionality
* Create and Save functionality
> The app uses Google's Translate API for on-demand translation and OAuth API for user verification.

**I have not included the server code because it contains sensitive information (API keys). I will upload an API key-free
version after cleaning the file.**
> Please email me if you have any other questions or concerns!
